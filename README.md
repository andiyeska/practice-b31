# Service Pattern

You are just accepted as a Software Development Engineer in a library of your city. 
The library just recently implement information system technology to support their activities. 

Because of the limited resource and tight deadline, the first version of the system is created without thinking too much about the pattern. 
Every logic is written under the Controller. So as you can see, there are some duplicated logics in the code. 

You have an idea to implement a pattern called Service Pattern. You raise the idea and the team want you to show them how does it looks like if the pattern is implemented on the system. 
So now you will update the code by implementing the pattern. **Good luck!**
