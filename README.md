# Command Pattern

After your update the code implementation by using Service Pattern, all the members agree to keep using that pattern.
After using it for some time, the system is growing.
The function in each is service is increasing.
It also makes total line of code in the implementation class is also growing.
Besides, the team want to make pre- and post- processes before the main process is being executed.
They said that this could be something like validation and fallback

The problem is if we implement pre- and post- process for each function, the line of code will be snowballing for every new function created.
You are aware of a pattern called Command Pattern.
You feel like this could be the solution of this problem.
So again, you are going to update the code by implementing the pattern and later present it to your team.
**Good luck!**
