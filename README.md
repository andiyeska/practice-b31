# Service Pattern

You are just accepted as a Software Development Engineer in a library of your city. 
Your coworker said that recently the library is implementing technology to support their activity. 

Because of the limited resource and tight deadline, the first version of the system is created without thinking too much about the pattern. 
Every logic is written under the Controller. So as you can see, there are some duplicated logic in the code. 

You have an idea to implement a pattern called Service Pattern. You raise the idea and the team want you to show them how does it looks like if the pattern is implemented on the system. 
So now update the code by implementing the pattern. **Good luck!**
